## Description

The project focused on creating a visualization that allows virtual objects 
to be placed in the real environment, displaying information about them, and modifying 
their position. Technological solutions were explored for developing augmented reality 
applications for both goggles and mobile devices, using off-the-shelf platforms
to enable interactions with mixed reality. The goal was to ensure a smooth process 
for designing the production floor.

## In real life tests

The tests were conducted in production floor in building B5 at Akademia GÃ³rniczo-Hutnicza w Krakowie.
